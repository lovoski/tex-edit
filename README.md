# explaination for the project

## project structure

- `server` : diretory for the server written with **C language**.

- `server/lib` : dependecy for the **C language** server, including shared library for `mysql-c-api`, no header file is included, so in order to compile the project with the `Makefile` script in the parental diretory, only `linux` system is recommended. (though there is the static library in the same path, I haven't written relative `Makefile` to link the static lib).

- `lib` : dependency for the **Qt-C++ project**, including the shared library of the open source library `qsciscintilla` I used for writting the qt-code-editor interface.

- `include` : the headers for `qsciscintilla`, though it's hard for someone else to compile the server on their machine, I want to make it easy for others to compile the client side on their own machine as simple as possible, so I include the headers in my project.

- `src` : the diretory where c++ source code lies.

- `ui` : store the `*.ui` file generated by `qt designer`
